I'm a software developer who is passionate about creating technology to elevate people and help new developers to find the right path. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Javascript, ReactJS, React-Native, and Firebase.

- ðŸ”­ I am currently in my final year pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the Arab Academy for Science, Technology, and Maritime Transport (AAST). I am proud to mention that I hold the third rank in my college. My academic journey is complemented by a continuous commitment to problem-solving, demonstrated by my consistent engagement on platforms like LeetCode for more than 300 days last year.

My current academic interests lie in the realms of Machine Learning and Data Engineering, with a specific focus on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and time series analysis
